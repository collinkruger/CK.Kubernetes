# Minimal Node App

A minimal Node.js app that
* Always returns "Hello World"
* Respects using Ctrl+C to exit

To run, open a terminal to this directory and run `node app.js`.

NOTE: This app will say it's running on IP 0.0.0.0 which means any network interface. You'll need to visit the app at localhost, 127.0.0.1, your public IP, etc. on the port listed.
